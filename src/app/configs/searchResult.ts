Immunotherapy has the potential to be effective in cancers with resistance to conventional therapy. Checkpoint inhibition, including Programmed cell Death 1 (PD-1)/Programmed cell Death protein 1 (PD-L1) blockade has shown great promise in treating diverse cancers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy for chordoma. To this end, using 4 chordoma cell lines, we examined the expression of PD-L1 and performed in vitro NK cells killing assay for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity mediated by the anti-PD-L1 antibody, avelumab. Here, the expression of PD-L1 was markedly upregulated by IFN-g in all 4 chordoma cell lines, which resulted in increasing the sensitivity to ADCC. Next, to model a patient that received a tumor-antigen specific vaccine, chordoma cells were co-incubated with brachyury specific CD8+ T cells, culminating in significant upregulation of PD-L1 on the tumor cells mediated by CD8+ T cells IFN-g production. The functional consequence was the sensitivity of chordoma cells to ADCC mediated by avelumab. Finally, residential cancer stem cell subpopulations of chordoma cells were killed by avelumab-mediated ADCC to the same degree as non-cancer stem cell populations. Our findings show the potential of avelumab therapy in chordoma; a) alone, to enable endogenous NK cells to kill chordoma cells via ADCC, or b) in conjunction with T cells immunotherapy such a vaccine, to exploit enhanced NK cell killing of chordoma cells via ADCC.","$":{"Name":"summary","Type":"String"}},{"_":"19251","$":{"Name":"GPL","Type":"String"}},{"_":"77732","$":{"Name":"GSE","Type":"String"}},{"_":"Homo sapiens","$":{"Name":"taxon","Type":"String"}},{"_":"GSE","$":{"Name":"entryType","Type":"String"}},{"_":"Expression profiling by array","$":{"Name":"gdsType","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"ptechType","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"valType","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"SSInfo","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"subsetInfo","Type":"String"}},{"_":"2017/01/01","$":{"Name":"PDAT","Type":"String"}},{"_":"CEL, CHP","$":{"Name":"suppFile","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"Samples","Type":"List"},"Item":[{"$":{"Name":"Sample","Type":"Structure"},"Item":[{"_":"GSM2057976","$":{"Name":"Accession","Type":"String"}},{"_":"UM-Chor1, IFN-gamma-treated, sample 2","$":{"Name":"Title","Type":"String"}}]},{"$":{"Name":"Sample","Type":"Structure"},"Item":[{"_":"GSM2057975","$":{"Name":"Accession","Type":"String"}},{"_":"UM-Chor1, IFN-gamma-treated, sample 1","$":{"Name":"Title","Type":"String"}}]},{"$":{"Name":"Sample","Type":"Structure"},"Item":[{"_":"GSM2057973","$":{"Name":"Accession","Type":"String"}},{"_":"UM-Chor1, untreated, sample 2","$":{"Name":"Title","Type":"String"}}]},{"$":{"Name":"Sample","Type":"Structure"},"Item":[{"_":"GSM2057972","$":{"Name":"Accession","Type":"String"}},{"_":"UM-Chor1, untreated, sample 1","$":{"Name":"Title","Type":"String"}}]},{"$":{"Name":"Sample","Type":"Structure"},"Item":[{"_":"GSM2057977","$":{"Name":"Accession","Type":"String"}},{"_":"UM-Chor1, IFN-gamma-treated, sample 3","$":{"Name":"Title","Type":"String"}}]},{"$":{"Name":"Sample","Type":"Structure"},"Item":[{"_":"GSM2057974","$":{"Name":"Accession","Type":"String"}},{"_":"UM-Chor1, untreated, sample 3","$":{"Name":"Title","Type":"String"}}]}]},{"$":{"Name":"Relations","Type":"List"}},{"$":{"Name":"ExtRelations","Type":"List"}},{"_":"6","$":{"Name":"n_samples","Type":"Integer"}},{"$":{"Name":"SeriesTitle","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"PlatformTitle","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"PlatformTaxa","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"SamplesTaxa","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"PubMedIds","Type":"List"}},{"$":{"Name":"Projects","Type":"List"}},{"_":"ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE77nnn/GSE77732/","$":{"Name":"FTPLink","Type":"String"}},{"_":"yes","$":{"Name":"GEO2R","Type":"String"}}]},{"Id":"200070771","Item":[{"_":"GSE70771","$":{"Name":"Accession","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"GDS","Type":"String"}},{"_":"Chordoma ATAC-Seq","$":{"Name":"title","Type":"String"}},{"_":"Chromatin profiling of chordoma collected by the Broad chordoma target discovery project","$":{"Name":"summary","Type":"String"}},{"_":"11154","$":{"Name":"GPL","Type":"String"}},{"_":"70771","$":{"Name":"GSE","Type":"String"}},{"_":"Homo sapiens","$":{"Name":"taxon","Type":"String"}},{"_":"GSE","$":{"Name":"entryType","Type":"String"}},{"_":"Other","$":{"Name":"gdsType","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"ptechType","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"valType","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"SSInfo","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"subsetInfo","Type":"String"}},{"_":"2015/07/11","$":{"Name":"PDAT","Type":"String"}},{"_":"WIG","$":{"Name":"suppFile","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"Samples","Type":"List"},"Item":[{"$":{"Name":"Sample","Type":"Structure"},"Item":[{"_":"GSM1818002","$":{"Name":"Accession","Type":"String"}},{"_":"UCH2_2","$":{"Name":"Title","Type":"String"}}]},{"$":{"Name":"Sample","Type":"Structure"},"Item":[{"_":"GSM1818001","$":{"Name":"Accession","Type":"String"}},{"_":"UCH2_1","$":{"Name":"Title","Type":"String"}}]},{"$":{"Name":"Sample","Type":"Structure"},"Item":[{"_":"GSM1818000","$":{"Name":"Accession","Type":"String"}},{"_":"MUGCHOR","$":{"Name":"Title","Type":"String"}}]}]},{"$":{"Name":"Relations","Type":"List"}},{"$":{"Name":"ExtRelations","Type":"List"},"Item":{"$":{"Name":"ExtRelation","Type":"Structure"},"Item":[{"_":"SRA","$":{"Name":"RelationType","Type":"String"}},{"_":"SRP060662","$":{"Name":"TargetObject","Type":"String"}},{"_":"ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sra-instant/reads/ByStudy/sra/SRP/SRP060/SRP060662/","$":{"Name":"TargetFTPLink","Type":"String"}}]}},{"_":"3","$":{"Name":"n_samples","Type":"Integer"}},{"$":{"Name":"SeriesTitle","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"PlatformTitle","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"PlatformTaxa","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"SamplesTaxa","Type":"String"}},{"$":{"Name":"PubMedIds","Type":"List"}},{"$":{"Name":"Projects","Type":"List"}},{"_":"ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE70nnn/GSE70771/","$":{"Name":"FTPLink","Type":"String"}},{"_":"yes","$":{"Name":"GEO2R","Type":"String"}}}]}};
